Abstract: Architecting Enterprise Resiliency: A Proven Blue/Green Deployment Framework for Zero-Downtime AWS RDBMS Operations with Advanced Logical Replication – An OmniBank Global Commercial Card Case Study

At OmniBank Global, maintaining continuous availability of critical applications and data is paramount to serving our clients and upholding our operational excellence.
Traditional database maintenance and application deployment often pose significant challenges, risking service interruptions that directly impact business operations and customer trust. 
This abstract presents a robust architectural framework for achieving true zero-downtime application development, patching, 
and upgrades for AWS Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), specifically leveraging advanced logical replication solutions within a sophisticated blue-green deployment methodology.
This solution is not theoretical; it is currently operational within OmniBank Global's Commercial Card domain, delivering tangible benefits, and we are actively automating its end-to-end deployment for broader enterprise adoption.

Our proven architecture addresses the inherent complexities of database operations by establishing fully independent Blue and Green environments, ensuring complete isolation and enabling comprehensive pre-production validation.
A robust logical replication solution is the cornerstone of this framework, providing real-time, bi-directional data consistency between environments during normal operations and facilitating seamless cutovers.
This enables the iterative development and rigorous testing of application changes, database patches, and major version upgrades in the Green environment, all while the Blue environment continues to serve live traffic.
The capability for rapid, reliable rollback to the stable Blue environment – also facilitated by the chosen logical replication mechanism – ensures maximum business continuity and significantly reduces the mean time to recovery (MTTR) in the face of unforeseen issues, a critical factor for financial services.

This session will also critically examine the limitations of native AWS Aurora's blue/green deployment options within a large enterprise context,
demonstrating how our custom-built, logical replication-enhanced solution overcomes these shortcomings to deliver superior control, flexibility, and reliability.
We will delve into the lessons learned from the Commercial Card implementation, providing insights into its reference architecture, the benefits realized,
and our ongoing efforts to fully automate the deployment and management lifecycle. Attendees will gain practical knowledge on selecting and integrating a suitable logical replication technology and understand how this proven methodology can be standardized and applied across diverse OmniBank Global applications utilizing AWS RDBMS. 
This architecture not only solves the immediate business problem of downtime but also fosters a culture of continuous delivery and operational excellence, contributing directly to OmniBank Global's strategic objectives of agility, reliability, and client satisfaction

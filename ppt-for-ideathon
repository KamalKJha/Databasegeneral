Title: Achieving Zero-Downtime Database Operations at OmniBank Global

Subtitle: A Proven Blue-Green Architecture for AWS RDBMS Powered by Advanced Logical Replication

Presented by: OmniBank Global, Commercial Card Domain

Core Message: Transforming a critical operational risk into a strategic competitive advantage through architectural innovation.

Visual Cue: A simple diagram showing two database icons labeled 'Blue' and 'Green'. An arrow labeled 'Live Traffic' points to 'Blue'. A dotted arrow shows traffic can be switched to 'Green'. A double-sided arrow between them is labeled 'Bi-directional Logical Replication'.
Slide 2: The Challenge vs. Our Solution
The Challenge: The High Cost of Downtime

Our Solution: An Advanced Blue-Green Framework

Traditional maintenance introduces unavoidable downtime for database patching, upgrades, and application deployments.

We establish fully independent Blue (Live) and Green (Standby) environments, ensuring complete isolation for safe, comprehensive testing.

Significant Business & Operational Risk: <br> • Missed transaction windows & revenue loss <br> • Service Level Agreement (SLA) breaches <br> • Frustrated clients & damaged trust

The cornerstone is a robust, bi-directional logical replication mechanism, providing real-time data consistency between the Blue and Green environments.

Native Cloud Solutions Fall Short: Standard tools often fail to meet the strict zero-downtime and instantaneous rollback requirements of complex enterprise applications.

This enables seamless cutovers to the Green environment after it has been fully patched, upgraded, and validated—all while live traffic continues uninterrupted on the Blue environment.

High Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR): Rollback procedures are slow, complex, and risky, often taking hours or days and causing extended disruption.

The architecture provides the critical capability for rapid, reliable rollback to the stable Blue environment, reducing MTTR from hours to mere minutes or seconds.

Slide 3: Proven Impact & The Path Forward
Business Impact: Realized in the Commercial Card Domain

Availability: Achieved 99.9999% uptime for core database operations, completely eliminating planned downtime.

Risk Reduction: Drastically reduced Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR), mitigating financial loss and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Agility & Speed: Accelerated release cycles by enabling safe, iterative development and testing in a production-parallel environment.

Client Satisfaction: Protected client trust and enhanced OmniBank's reputation for reliability and unparalleled service.

Lessons Learned & Strategic Next Steps

Key Insight: The success of this architecture hinges on selecting the right logical replication technology that supports bi-directional consistency and instantaneous cutover/rollback.

Current Focus: We are actively automating the end-to-end deployment and management lifecycle of this framework to reduce manual overhead and ensure consistency.

Future State: Generalize this proven reference architecture as a standardized, enterprise-wide solution for all OmniBank Global applications utilizing AWS RDBMS.

Conclusion: This architecture is a key enabler of OmniBank Global's strategic objectives, delivering agility, superior reliability, and a significant competitive advantage.
